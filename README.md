# Smart Glasses App Prototype - 1st Class Grade Achieved

This repository contains part of my **Element 2 submission**, and the **Element 1 proposal**. Forms and Python cleaning scripts not included.

The project explores the design, development, and evaluation of a **Smart Glasses application prototype**, supported by structured research, eye-tracking data analysis, and user interviews. 

## Overall Aim

The overall aim of this project was to collect data using the **Tobii Pro Eye-Tracking Tool** and upon analysis of this data, develop a tool/product that can benefit. The product that we prototyped in this project was **Smart Glasses**, glasses that will adjust saturation based on the user's stimulation levels.
